# About

The Crypto Market Watch application is for tracking the top 250 cryptocurrencies. You can view information about specific coins by clicking on one of the cryptocurrency names in the market list. There's also a calculator feature where you can calculate how much a particular coin would be worth if you bought a certain amount on a particular day. 

In the market overview page (the homepage), you can click on certain column titles to sort the list. 

#How the app was developed

I used React, Redux, React Router, Axios, and Reactstrap to develop this application. The data used in this application is pulled from the CoinGecko API. The application pulls from CoinGecko roughly every 30 seconds for up-to-date data.
